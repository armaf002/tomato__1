# Problem Research on Tomato Disease Classifier App

## Introduction

Tomatoes are one of the most widely cultivated crops globally, essential for both commercial and subsistence farming. However, tomato plants are susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly reduce yield and quality. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for effective management and control, ultimately ensuring food security and economic stability for farmers.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective is to develop a Tomato Disease Classifier App using custom vision technology to accurately identify and classify common tomato diseases and azure openai technology to generate response regarding any question about tomato diseases that is been asked. This solution aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection, enabling timely and targeted interventions.

## Importance of Early Detection

Early detection of tomato diseases can prevent widespread crop damage, reduce the need for extensive chemical treatments, and improve overall crop health. Timely interventions based on accurate disease identification can lead to:

- **Improved Crop Yields**: By managing diseases early, farmers can ensure higher and better-quality yields.
- **Cost Savings**: Reducing the need for broad-spectrum pesticides and minimizing crop loss.
- **Environmental Benefits**: Lower chemical usage leads to a reduced environmental footprint.
- **Food Security**: Ensuring a stable supply of tomatoes for consumption and industry.

## Common Tomato Diseases

Tomato plants can be affected by several diseases, including:

1. **Tomato Leaf Blight**: Caused by fungi, leading to browning and dying leaves.
2. **Tomato Leaf Curl**: Viral disease causing leaf deformation and stunted growth.
3. **Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot**: Fungal infection resulting in circular spots on leaves.
4. **Tomato Verticillium Wilt**: Soil-borne fungus causing wilting and yellowing of leaves.

## Challenges in Disease Detection

Identifying tomato diseases based solely on visual symptoms is challenging due to the following factors:

- **Similarity of Symptoms**: Different diseases can exhibit similar symptoms, making manual identification difficult.
- **Environmental Influence**: Symptoms can vary with environmental conditions, affecting accuracy.
- **Scale of Monitoring**: Manual monitoring of large fields is labor-intensive and prone to human error.
