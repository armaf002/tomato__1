## Solution Identification

### Overview

This document outlines the identified solution for developing a Tomato Disease Classifier web App using custom vision technology and Azure OpenAI services. The app aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in the early detection and classification of common tomato diseases, leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, as well as natural language processing for answering questions about tomato diseases.

### Problem Statement Recap

Tomato plants are vulnerable to a variety of diseases that can severely impact yield and quality. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective disease management. Traditional methods of disease identification are often labor-intensive and prone to human error. Therefore, an automated, accurate, and user-friendly solution is needed to help farmers identify tomato diseases promptly.

### Solution Components

#### 1. Custom Vision Model

**Description**:
A machine learning model trained using the Custom Vision service by Azure, designed to classify images of tomato plants into different disease categories.

**Features**:
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure reliable disease detection.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large volumes of image data for robust performance.
- **Updatable**: The model can be regularly updated with new data to improve accuracy over time.

#### 2. Dataset

**Description**:
The dataset used for training the model includes images of tomato plants affected by various diseases. The dataset is sourced from the Crop Pest and Disease Detection Dataset available on [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bwh3zbpkpv/1).

**Key Statistics**:
- **Healthy Tomato**: 2,000 images
- **Tomato Leaf Blight**: 5,200 images
- **Tomato Leaf Curl**: 2,050 images
- **Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot**: 9,375 images
- **Tomato Verticillium Wilt**: 3,100 images

**Training Subset**:
1,000 images from each disease category were selected for training, making a total of 6,000 images. This subset was chosen due to the maximum data limit imposed by the Custom Vision service.

#### 3. Web App or Power App

**Description**:
The user interface through which users will interact with the classifier. Depending on the deployment method, it can be a web application or a Power App.

**Features**:
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of tomato plants for disease diagnosis.
- **Real-Time Results**: The app provides instant feedback on the uploaded images, identifying the disease and suggesting possible interventions.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for users with minimal technical expertise.

#### 4. Azure OpenAI Service for Q&A

**Description**:
The component responsible for answering user questions about tomato diseases using natural language processing.

**Features**:
- **Question Understanding**: Leverages Azure OpenAI service to understand and process user queries.
- **Informative Responses**: Provides detailed and accurate responses to questions about tomato diseases, symptoms, treatments, and prevention methods.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Capable of handling a wide range of queries with contextual relevance.
