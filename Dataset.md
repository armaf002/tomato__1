## Tomato Disease Data

For the purpose of developing our tomato disease classifier, we are focusing on the tomato-specific data within this dataset, which includes images of healthy and diseased tomato plants categorized into the following classes:

- **Healthy Tomato**: 2,000 images
- **Tomato Leaf Blight**: 5,200 images
- **Tomato Leaf Curl**: 2,050 images
- **Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot**: 9,375 images
- **Tomato Verticillium Wilt**: 3,100 images

**Training Dataset**:
For training purposes, 1,000 images from each disease category were used, making a total of 6,000 images. This subset was chosen due to the maximum data limit imposed by the Custom Vision service, which can train on a maximum of 6,000 images.

This dataset is a valuable resource for developing and testing models for the classification and detection of tomato diseases, leveraging both raw and augmented image data to enhance model robustness and accuracy.
