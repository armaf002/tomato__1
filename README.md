## Project Description

Our project aims to develop a Tomato Disease Classifier App using Azure Custom Vision, Azure Web App, and Azure OpenAI Service technology. The app targets farmers and agricultural professionals, providing them with a tool for early detection and classification of common tomato diseases. Leveraging machine learning, computer vision techniques, and natural language processing, the app will assist in identifying diseases promptly, thereby enabling effective disease management and enhancing crop yield and quality.

We chose this project because we recognize the significant impact that tomato diseases can have on agricultural productivity. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for mitigating these impacts. Traditional methods of disease identification are often time-consuming and error-prone. By developing an automated solution using advanced technologies like machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, we aim to provide farmers with a more efficient and reliable tool for disease detection and management.

### Key Features

1. **Custom Vision Model**: Utilizes Azure Custom Vision to classify images of tomato plants into different disease categories with high accuracy.
2. **Web Application**: Developed using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, providing a user-friendly interface for image upload and disease prediction.
3. **Azure OpenAI Service**: Integrated to handle user queries about tomato diseases, offering informative and contextually relevant responses.
4. **Azure Web App**: Chosen as the deployment platform for hosting the web application, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Project Goals

- **Early Detection**: Enable farmers to identify tomato diseases early, allowing for timely intervention.
- **Accuracy**: Provide accurate disease classification to improve crop health management.
- **User-Friendly**: Develop an intuitive and easy-to-use application that caters to users with minimal technical expertise.
- **Informative**: Offer valuable insights and answers to user queries about tomato diseases through the integration of Azure OpenAI Service.

Through this project, we hope to contribute to the agricultural sector by empowering farmers with innovative technologies that improve crop health and productivity. Our team is committed to delivering a user-friendly application that meets the needs of our target users while addressing the challenges associated with tomato disease management.
